Memory Matching Game 
This is the second project on the Front End Nano Degree (FEND) Programme by Udacity. 
It is a game to match a pair of cards on a board. 
the Player is required to click on a pair of cards and if matched the cards remain opened. 
but if not matched the cards are turned downwards, until the right selection is made. 
A time tracks how long the player spends on the game and number of card pairs opened to complete the game. 
A star rating is given at the end of the game ; one star indicates a super champion and three stars a champion.
This project was done using HTML,CSS and JS. The purpose is to put into practice and use all that has been taught during this programme using these three languages.
